IRC-Bot | Author: bl4ckscor3 | Made with PircBotX 2.1 | Used libraries: Selenium, JSoup and some AOSP classes (see Apache-License part)

Thanks to Lord_Ralex for help on the [restructure commit](http://github.com/bl4ckscor3/bl4ckb0t/commit/0703810f5870d2cdb7c678ff983671c2884fa7e9), he basically did the whole work :)

Additionally to the Maven dependencies, you have to download, and add to your build path, the latest **STANDALONE** version of [HtmlUnitDriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/htmlunit-driver) to build the bot.

_Software used under the [Apache-License](https://github.com/bl4ckscor3/bl4ckb0t/blob/master/APACHELICENSE.md):_
- **Objects.java** from libcore (The Android Open Source Project)
- **EmptyArray.java** from libcore (The Android Open Source Project)
- **ArrayMap.java** from android (The Android Open Source Project)
- **ContainerHelper.java** from android (The Android Open Source Project)
- **MapCollections.java** from android (The Android Open Source Project)

Some of these classes have been slightly edited to ignore warnings eclipse shows and to adapt the packages they're placed in.
